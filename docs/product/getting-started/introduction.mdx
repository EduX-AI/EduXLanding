# Meet EduX

![image](/integrations.png)

The problem EduX addresses is the complexity and inefficiency of higher education scheduling. With universities hiring student success advisors and faculty members handling the manual process, there are many inefficiencies with how universities are currently handling scheduling. 

Students struggle to navigate courses that are offered, understanding the prerequisites for each class, scheduling conflicts, and aligning with the degree requirements. These are just some of the many reasons students are delayed in their graduation causing suboptimal learning experiences. 

EduX handles all of the pain points addressing a proper route towards graduation that is altered based on each student's individual schedules and majors.
